    "Web Scraping is the technique of automatically extracting data from websites using software/script. \n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data \n",
    "from websites. \n",
    "The web scraping software may directly access the World Wide Web using the Hypertext Transfer\n",
    "Protocol or a web browser. \n",
    "While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes\n",
    "implemented using a bot or web crawler. It is a form of copying in which specific data is gathered and copied \n",
    "from the web, typically into a central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or\n",
    "analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping a web page involves fetching it and extracting from it. \n",
    "Fetching is the downloading of a page (which a browser does when a user views a page). \n",
    "Therefore, web crawling is a main component of web scraping, to fetch pages for later processing. \n",
    "Once fetched, then extraction can take place. The content of a page may be parsed, searched, reformatted, \n",
    "its data copied into a spreadsheet or loaded into a database. Web scrapers typically take something out of a \n",
    "page, to make use of it for another purpose somewhere else. An example would be to find and copy names and\n",
    "telephone numbers, or companies and their URLs, or e-mail addresses to a list (contact scraping).\n",
    "\n",
    "Helpful:\n",
    "Web scraping can help us extract any kind of data that we want.It helps in retrieving, analyzing and using the data the way we want. So web scraping simplifies the process of extracting data, speeds it up by automating it and creates easy access to the scrapped data by providing it in a CSV format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Legal area :\n",
    "The real question here should be regarding how you plan to use the data which you have\n",
    "extracted from a website (either manually or via using software). Because the data displayed \n",
    "by most website is for public consumption. It is totally legal to copy this information to a \n",
    "file in your computer. But it is regarding how you plan to use this data that you should be \n",
    "careful about. If the data is downloaded for your personal use and analysis, then it is\n",
    "absolutely ethical. But in case you are planning to use it as your own, in your website, \n",
    "in a way which is completely against the interest of the original owner of the data, without \n",
    "attributing the original owner, then it is unethical, illegal.   "
